## My Resume

This repository contains the TeX source for my current resume, as well as the most currently rendered PDF. You will find the source for the document structure in `resume.tex`, and the document styling in `schoens-cv.cls`. The rendered PDF will always be up to date with the source.

If you have any questions, or my resume has caught your eye for one reason or another, feel free to reach out to me via email, and I'll respond as soon as I'm able.
