\noindent \emph{I'm an experienced software engineer with a love for open source, languages and distributed computing, and a passion for developing high-quality software.}
\\
\\
I started out in IT as a network engineer, working with Cisco equipment, but it wasn't long before I had delved in to writing scripts for automation. Once I had a taste for code, I knew it was where I belonged, and I was relentless in purusing an open developer position at the same company. I was given the opportunity, and I've been a software engineer ever since.

I was thrown in to the world of software engineering, and had to learn fast. I've soaked up books, blogs, talks, whatever I could. I have become proficient in numerous languages, technologies, and practices along the way, and achieved mastery in many of them.

I'm active in open source. I experiment with embedded development. I love functional programming and the challenges of concurrency and distribution. But most of all, I love building software.
