\noindent \emph{I'm an experienced software engineer with a love for open source, languages and distributed computing, and a passion for developing high-quality software.}
\\
\\
I started out in IT as a network engineer, working with Cisco equipment, but it wasn't long before I had delved in to writing scripts for automation. Once I had a taste for code, I knew it was where I belonged, and I was relentless in pursuing an open developer position at the same company. I was given the opportunity, and I've been a software engineer ever since.

I was thrown in to the world of software engineering, and had to learn fast. I've soaked up books, blogs, talks, whatever I could. I have become proficient in numerous languages, technologies, and practices along the way, and achieved mastery in many of them.

I'm active in open source. I experiment with embedded development. I love functional programming and the challenges of concurrency and distribution. But most of all, I love building software.

    {Senior Web and Infrastructure Engineer}
    {Oct \apo15 -- present}
    {\bodytext{Lead developer on some of Exosite's most critical core services, built on Erlang and Elixir, with a few in Go (with parts written in C). Became very proficient with an array of AWS services, as well as  Kubernetes in order to implement an OpenShift-based hosting platform for customer and internal applications. The applications I built were distributed, highly concurrent infrastructure services, with all the resultant challenges. I am heavily involved in the Erlang/Elixir community, and gave two talks, one at ElixirConf 2015, and one at ElixirConf 2016.}}
