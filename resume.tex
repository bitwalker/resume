\noindent \emph{I'm a nerd with a love for open source, embedded and distributed computing, and a passion for developing high-quality software.}
\\
\\
I started out in IT as a network engineer, working with Cisco equipment, but it wasn't long before I had delved in to writing scripts for automation. Once I had a taste for code, I knew it was where I belonged, and I was relentless in purusing an open developer position at the same company. I was given the opportunity, and I've been a software engineer ever since.

I was thrown in to the world of software engineering, and had to learn fast. I soaked up books, blogs, talks, whatever I could. The tools I was given were C\#, HTML/CSS, Javascript, as well as Bash and Powershell. I picked up Ruby and a bit of Python for scripting not long after, and my curiousity was piqued. Slowly I've added Clojure, Scala, F\#, Erlang and Elixir to the list

I'm active in open source. I experiment with embedded dev, and have a Pi and Arduino. I'm a strong believer in concurrency, distribution, and functional programming. But most of all, I love building software.
