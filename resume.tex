\section{experience}

\begin{entrylist}
	\entry
		{since May}
		{Senior Software Developer}
		{Surge LLC.}
		{Lead developer on three projects. Developed expertise with Adobe InDesign Server and %
		 InDesign Markup Language.}
	\entry
		{2010-2012}
		{Software Developer}
		{ProtoLabs Inc.}
		{Primary developer of numerous projects. Most developers at ProtoLabs fit in to one of two teams, %
		 web or backend - I was the exception, primarily devoted to R\&D applications with focus towards %
		 internal process improvement and reporting/data mining capability.}
	\entry
		{since 2010}
		{Avionics Systems Journeyman}
		{United States Air Force}
		{My second job is with the Air National Guard/USAF out of Madison, WI - where I work as a flightline %
		 avionics technician on Lockheed Martin F-16C/D fighter jets. I'm currently a Senior Airman, working %
		 towards my Staff Sergeant stripes.}
	\entry
		{2008-2010}
		{Software Developer}
		{Business Card Services Inc.}
		{The entirety of my time at BCSI was spent as the primary developer behind a project to port a %
		 legacy manufacturing process written and maintained since the late 80's to a modern, C\# and ASP.NET %
		 driven system, while expanding it's capabilities, and providing some new reporting and data mining %
		 features that the old system could not provide. After the first release of the new software, I left %
		 for training with the United States Air Force.}
	\entry
		{2006-2008}
		{Software Developer}
		{Warner Connect Inc.}
		{I started at WC as a Network Engineer - architecting, implementing and maintaining new network %
		 systems at our clients locations. Within six months however, I had convinced my boss to let me take %
		 over the newly formed Development branch of the company, and begin my professional career in software%
		  development. This was where I first gained exposure to C\#, ASP.NET, Classic ASP, T-SQL, and all of %
		 tools and techniques that come along with them.}
